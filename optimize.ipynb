    "The first idea that comes to mind is to make a straight forward mathematical translation of the oral problem description. That would be to set a vector of *i* integer variables *x[i]*, representing the number of proton fractions that should be performed to patient *i*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would then symbolize our input matrix as *c[i,j]*: the benefit of offering *j* proton fractions to patient *i*. While this is a very intuitive model it suffers from a very non linear object function. In the simplest case where we would like to optimize the sum or average BED, the object functions to be maximized would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**f = Σ c[i, x[i]] over all i's**\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>A better modeling idea</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we would prefer to go with a linear model. For that reason we could select another set of decision variables, that is a binary matrix *x[i,j]* where a value of 1 denotes that *j* fractions should be performed on patient *i*. Obviously we should constraint every rows sum to 1 (a patient will receive 0,1, ... or N fractions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our object function can now be expressed as elegandly as:\n",
    "\n",
    "**f = Σ c[i,j] * x[i,j] over all j's over all i's**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obviously as linear as it gets. Lets code it!"
